# Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition

The purpose of this document is to detail the software that runs the Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition.

## Stages

To produce a Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, it is necessary to [TODO: write a couple of paragraphs on this, citing original sources].

One of the beautiful things about Kitagawa's original analysis was that it was fully categorical. Though she did not describe it that way, she essentially ran a fully interacted regression and used the resulting coefficients in her decomposition. The beauty of this approach is that population averages in the two references periods are fully sufficient to produce the KOB decomposition: no microdata are needed. She did not include standard errors in her original estimates, but those are straightforward to produce in the outcome estimates using the technique described by the census [here](ADD A LINKL!!!!!!)
On a fully categorical regression, this takes on the following functional form:
