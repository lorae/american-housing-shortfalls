# Introduction

The purpose of this document is to detail the software that runs the Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition.

# Stages

To produce a Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, it is necessary to [TODO: write a couple of paragraphs on this, citing original sources].

One of the beautiful things about Kitagawa's original analysis was that it was fully categorical. Though she did not describe it that way, she essentially ran a fully interacted regression and used the resulting coefficients in her decomposition.

The beauty of this approach is that **population averages in the two reference periods are fully sufficient to produce the KOB decomposition**: no microdata are needed.

She did not include standard errors in her original estimates, but those are straightforward to produce in the outcome estimates using the technique described by the Census [here](ADD A LINK!!!!!!).

## Regression functional forms

Let $S_i$ represent the predicted household size for person $i$ in survey year $y$. Regressions include all persons not in group quarters. All variables are discrete. Specifically:

- **Race & Ethnicity**: Mutually exclusive groups of AAPI, AIAN, Black, Hispanic, Multiracial, White, and Other. For more information on how categorizations are drawn, please refer to the [codebook](TODO!).
- **Age**: Comprised of 17 5-year age buckets, spanning from 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, ..., 80-84, and 85+.
- **Education**: Highest education attained. Includes less than high school, high school only, less than 4 years of college, and 4+ years of college.
- **CPI-U Adjusted Total Income**: Total personal income (TODO: factcheck that this is what the INCTOT variable represents), deflated/inflated to 2010 values and bucketed into negative, \$0 - \$29,999, \$30,000 - \$59,999, \$60,000 - \$100,000 ... (TODO: what else?)
- **US-Born**: True if born in the United States, False if otherwise.
- **Gender**: Female or male.
- **Tenure**: Homeowner or renter.

**Regression 0:**
$$
S_{i, y} = \beta_{0,y} + \beta_{1,y}(\text{Race & Ethnicity}_i) + \beta_{2,y}(\text{Age}_i) + \beta_{3,y}(\text{Education}_i) + \beta_{4,y}(\text{CPI-U Adjusted Total Income}_i) + \beta_{5,y}(\text{US-Born}_i) + \beta_{6,y}(\text{Gender}_i) + \beta_{7,y}(\text{Tenure}) + \epsilon
$$
reg00_2019_results_se <- svyglm(
  NUMPREC ~ RACE_ETH_bucket + AGE_bucket + EDUC_bucket + INCTOT_cpiu_2010_bucket 
  + us_born + gender + tenure,
  design = design)
**Regression 1:**

**Regression 2:**


## KOB Tranformation

On a fully categorical regression, this takes on the following functional form:

$$
\Delta \bar{Y} = (\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_B) \cdot \beta_B + \bar{X}_B \cdot (\beta_A - \beta_B)
$$

Where:

- $\bar{Y}$ is the average outcome,
- $\bar{X}$ is the vector of average covariate values,
- $\beta$ are the estimated coefficients from the fully categorical regression,
- and $A$, $B$ refer to the two time periods or groups being compared.
